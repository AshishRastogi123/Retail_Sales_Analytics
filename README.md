## Overview

Retail Sales Analytics provides an end-to-end working example for analyzing point-of-sale and retail datasets. The goal is to help analysts and data practitioners:

- Clean and prepare sales and transactional data.
- Explore sales trends, seasonality, and product/category performance.
- Build reproducible visualizations and dashboards (Power BI or notebook-based).
- Share clear insights and recommendations for business decisions.

## Features

- Data ingestion and basic validation (CSV / SQL / local files)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering using Pandas & NumPy
- Exploratory data analysis (EDAs) with plots and tables
- Reproducible Jupyter notebook demonstrating workflow
- Export-ready visualizations and Power BI-ready artifacts

## Repository structure

- `IOT Project main .ipynb` — primary Jupyter notebook with analysis and visualizations
- `assets/` — diagrams and images used in this README
- `README.md` — this document

> Note: add your raw data files to a `data/` folder (gitignored) or point scripts to their data source.

## Data

This project uses retail transaction data (CSV / POS exports). The README doesn't include data for privacy reasons — add your own dataset to a local `data/` directory or configure a data source in the notebooks.

Suggested columns in dataset:

- transaction_id, date, store_id, product_id, category, quantity, price, revenue

## Getting started

Minimal steps to run the provided notebook locally.

1. Install Python 3.9+ (recommended) and create a virtual environment.
2. Install required packages (example):

	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

	jupyter notebook "IOT Project main .ipynb"

If you prefer Power BI for dashboards, import or connect to the processed CSV or a small SQL table exported from the notebook.

## Notebooks & scripts

- `IOT Project main .ipynb` — contains the main data cleaning, EDA, and sample visualizations. Read the top cells for environment and dataset instructions.

Tips:

- Keep long-running data processing outside notebooks in scripts for reproducibility.
- Use small sample files for iterative development and the full dataset for final runs.

## Visuals & Dashboards

This repo demonstrates common visualizations for retail analytics:

- Time series of revenue and quantity sold
- Top products by revenue and margin
- Sales by store and region
- Seasonal trends and moving averages

Power BI: export processed tables (CSV or SQL) and build dashboards in Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.

## Architecture

Below is a simplified architecture showing data flow from sources to insights.

## Quick checklist / contract

- Inputs: CSV or SQL retail transaction data
- Outputs: exploratory visualizations, summary tables, dashboards
- Error modes: missing columns, malformed dates, duplicate transaction IDs — notebook includes simple checks

Edge cases considered:

- Empty or partial datasets — notebook runs with guarded checks
- Large files — process in chunks or using a database
- Missing price/quantity — flagged and either imputed or removed

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature or fix.
3. Add tests or verify notebooks run end-to-end.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `requirements.txt` generated from the notebook.
- Create a small `data/README.md` describing expected dataset columns and example sample.
- Add a `.gitignore` that excludes data files and environment folders.

If you want any of those, tell me which and I'll add them next.
